ARC-AGI Task 423a55dc Solver

Transformation rule: Horizontal shear
For each non-zero pixel at (r, c):
  - Find the max row index (max_r) containing that color
  - Transform to (r, max(0, c - (max_r - r)))
  - Ignore pixels that would map to negative columns (clip to 0)
  - When multiple pixels map to the same location, any of them is acceptable
    (appears to be a weighted/probability selection)
